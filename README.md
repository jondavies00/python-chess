# Python Chess

This is a console-based chess implementation in python. Play against a randomised AI (that prioritises captures).

## Installation:
Simply clone the git respository and run 'Chess_final.py'.

## How to play:
Enter the square you would like to move a piece from (e.g. e2) and then a square (e.g. e4). This will update the board, and the AI will take a turn.
